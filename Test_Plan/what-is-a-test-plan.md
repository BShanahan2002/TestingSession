# What is a test plan
> And why do you need one?

A test plan is a detailed document that outlines the test strategy, objectives, resources needed, schedule, and success criteria for testing a specific new feature or piece of software.

The main goal, of course, is to discover defects, errors, and any other gap that might cause the software to not act as intended or provide a bad experience for your users. More specifically, a test plan ensures your software:

- Meets the requirements that guided its design and development (In other words, does it do what it’s supposed to do when it’s supposed to do it?)
- Responds correctly to all kinds of inputs
- Lives up to the performance standards you’ve outlined and can be used as intended
- Can be installed and run in all intended environments
- Achieves the results you and your stakeholders are after

It’s nearly impossible to test every scenario, environment, or use case your software will encounter during its lifecycle. Instead, software errors, bugs, and defects could pop up from:

- Coding errors - i.e. bugs
- Requirement gaps - i.e. unrecognized or overlooked requirements such as edge cases, scalability, or even security.
- Environment changes - i.e. new software, hardware, alterations in source data…

This makes writing a clear, yet comprehensive test plan a difficult balance. You want to include as much detail as possible to make sure you’re not missing any glaring errors. But you also don’t want to drown your team in testing tasks, delay your release, or add in new errors from your “fixes.”
