# Test plan

## Why do you need a test plan

You might think software testing wonâ€™t result in as serious consequences for your company. 
However, a 2017 study found that software failures cost the U.S. economy $1.7 trillion (Â£1.4 trillion ) ðŸ¤¯ in financial losses (and more than 268 years in downtime) that couldâ€™ve been avoided with proper testing.

Before any piece of software or new feature goes out to your users, you need to thoroughly put it through its paces. Test it. Try to break it. And make sure that whatever your users do, it responds as designed.

In short, you need a test plan!

# Not having a test plan

In 1962, NASA launched the Mariner 1 as their first attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus. However, shortly after it launched, the rocket veered off course and was forced to self destruct.
The cost? $135 million (Â£112 million ) - (in todayâ€™s dollars).
The issue? A missing hyphen in the code.
